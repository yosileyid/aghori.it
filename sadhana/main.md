Sadhana means spiritual path, i.e. the set of all practices, rituals and austerities that are performed with regularity and concentration, with the aim of obtaining Moksha (liberation). It is an act of purifying and enlarging the mind, leading to the state of Self Realization.

In the tantras it is stated that Shiva, in his infinite grace, full of compassion for suffering beings in this dark age, proclaimed tantric sadhana by means of spiritual emancipation. Tantrism is not a simple theory or philosophy, but above all it prescribes a systematic sadhana, a regular discipline, according to the temperament, ability and evolutionary degree of the practitioner. A formidable opportunity to experience extraordinary techniques for spiritual evolution, introducing yourself to the world of yantra, mantra and tantra.

Yantra, mantra and tantra symbolically represent the three paths of Hinduism. Yantra represents the path of knowledge (Jñanamarg), mantra represents the path of devotion (Bhaktimarg), tantra represents the path of action (Karmasanyasmarg).

## Some aghori sadhanas:

- Pātra Sadhana (ritual offerings). There are 324 types of Pātra Sadhana
- Śava Sadhana (done by sitting on a dead body)
- Smashan Sadhana (done in a cremation ground)
- Pancha Munda Sadhana. (done by sitting on five skulls)

N.B. The procedures of these Sadhanas are secret (Gupta), handed down only from Guru to disciple.

## Panchamakara:
#### Madya (wine) - Māṃsa (meat) - Matsya (fish) - Mudrā (grains) - Maithuna (union)

Pancha Makara is also known as the Five Ms. In this Sadhana the five elements are purified and energized by the mantra, through them and together with the identification with one's divinity the Aghori can develop the divine connection with the cosmic Shakti.

They are as follows:

- Madya: wine. It represents the divine nectar also called Amrita. Transform the Fire Tattva.
- Māṃsa: meat. Represents for language control. Silence. Transform the Air Tattva.
- Matsya - fish. It represents the Nadi Ida and Pingala which are controlled by the sadhaka (spiritual seeker) through the practice of Pranayama. Transform the Water Tattva.
- Mudra: grains. It represents spiritual companionship but also upright posture. Transform the Earth Tattva.
- Maithuna: This is the most misunderstood concept of Pancha Makara. Maithuna literally means union, it represents the union between the goddess Kundalini and Shiva. Transform the Aether Tattva.

In the Panchamakara Sadhana the subtle properties of each element are known and released with the awakening of the Kundalini and her consequent ascent. Here the Aghori will be able to experience the perfect awareness of the microcosmic world and will be able to internally use the properties of each element. When the Kundalini reaches Visarga Bindu, the divine nectar is blessed.

While the macroscopic world is only a limited reality, depending on which level the self exists, the complete understanding of the microcosmic levels will give an understanding of all the worlds that exist in the subtle levels, levels that have equal representations in the macrocosmic space. After the ascent up to the Visarga Bindu, the Kundalini starts its downward journey once again visiting all the subtle worlds.

Upon attaining the Kundalini's original residence on Muladhara Chakra, the Aghori can now comprehend the world with a new awareness and the identification with the deity is getting closer and closer to perfection.

## Shava Sadhana

Shava Sadhana (शाव साधना) is a spiritual practice of the Vamachara Tantra where the Sadhaka sits in meditation over a dead body. Shava Sadhana is considered the pinnacle of tantric philosophy, it is one of the most important, most difficult and most secret rituals of tantra. There are strict rules that must be followed in the ritual and in choosing the suitable corpse and specific and secret mantras are used. If the ritual is not performed correctly it can lead to dire consequences. Even a small mistake in the ritual can lead to the practitioner's death or insanity. Very few, including the aghori, know the correct procedures which are handed down only from guru to disciple. This naturally gives rise to many conjectures and misunderstandings that lead to false and incorrect procedures or even videos that are totally distant from the original ritual which remains secret and must not be filmed.

Through the Shava Sadhana we explore that thing that everyone is so afraid of, death. The ritual is done using a corpse, considered by Hindus to be a highly impure symbol and a taboo. The close encounter and union with death overcomes this fear and leads to liberation. The aim is to unite the Kundalini with Param-Shiva. It is an alchemical process that transforms gross energies into subtle energies. From a yogic or tantric point of view, it means detachment from the physical world and union with the Absolute. Detachment leads to liberation from Samsara (the cycle of birth, death and reincarnation) and places us beyond all duality in a cosmic union.

Shava Sadhana is performed at night on Amavasya (new moon) in a crematorium, holy place or any solitary place. In various tantric texts (such as the Tantrasara, the Nilatantra, the Kaulavali-nirnaya, the Kulachudamani and others) the rules and procedures for performing it are described but the mantras and many procedures remain gupta (secret) and only the guru can impart them to the disciple.

## Nyasa 

Nyasa is a Sanskrit word which means "to place", "to apply". Many tantric rituals and Pujas include Nyasa rituals which involve a series of touches to specific points on the body, in special sequences and using Mudras. Nyasa is a consecration, a deification of the worshiper's body, bringing the presence of a divinity into the body, it is the macrocosm reflected in the microcosm.

There are different types of Nyasa practice, some very complex and elaborate, the most important of which are Kara Nyasa and Anga Nyasa. Some of the most common are:

- Rishi Nyasa where the basic characteristics of the mantra are placed on the body.
- Kara Nyasa where the five elements are placed on the hands.
- Anga Nyasa where deities are placed on the body.
- Matrika Nyasa where the 50 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet are placed on the body.
