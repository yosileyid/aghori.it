<p class="display-2 fw-bold">Kali Ma</p>
* * *

The black goddess appears for the first time in the Devi Mahatmya or Durga Saptasati from the Marcandeya Purana. The devotion to Kali,, the goddess that more expresses the archetype of the great mother, has its fulcrum in the tantrism. Her form so terrible symbolizes the power, the strength, the good that defeats the evil, and is the demonstration of the divine power. Black because it is the color where everything disappears, also called Digambari (dressed of sky), Naked and with great breasts as the primordial goddesses.

Shiva in the Mahanirvana Tantra describes it thus:

<pre class="text-warning">
As white, yellow and all other colors disappear into black, 
similarly all beings enter Kali.

So it is for those who have attained the knowledge of the 
tools for final liberation, that Kalashakti (Kali, without 
Her Time, Kala, ceases to exist) attributeless, formless 
and beneficent, has the color of darkness.

Since the eternal, inexhaustible and beneficial in the form 
of Kala (Time) is Nectar itself, therefore the sign of the 
Moon is placed on His forehead (from the Moon flows Nectar)

As She beholds the entire universe, which is the product of 
Time (the Universe is Brahman in the form of Space-Time which 
is Maya) , with Her three eyes - the Moon, the Sun, and Fire
 - therefore She has three eyes.

As She devours all existence, as She chews all that exists 
with Her fierce teeth (Kala-danta, the teeth which are Time), 
therefore the blood is imagined as the clothing of the Queen 
of Devas (at final dissolution) .

As She time and again protects all beings from danger, and 
as She directs them in the paths of duty, Her hands are 
raised to dispel fear and bestow blessings.

As She encompasses the universe, which is the product of Rajoguna 
(Passion, active quality) , She is described as the Devi who is 
seated on the red lotus, watching Kala drunk with intoxicating 
wine and playing with the universe. Also the Devi, whose substance 
is intelligence, bears witness to all things.
