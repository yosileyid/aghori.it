### The 10 Aspects of Adi Parashakti

In Tantra, the worship of Devi or Shakti is referred to as Vidya (lit. Knowledge - Wisdom). Among the innumerable tantric practices, the worship of the ten main Shaktis is called Dasa Mahavidya. These ten aspects of Shakti are the personification of the entire creation.

The Mahavidyas are considered tantric in nature and are usually identified as:

- Kali : The ultimate form of Brahman , " Devourer of Time " .
- Tara: The Goddess who is guide, protector and savior. She who offers the ultimate knowledge that gives salvation (also known as Neel Saraswati).
- Shodashi or Lalita Tripurasundari: The Goddess who is "beautiful in the three worlds", the "tantric Parvati" or the "Moksha Mukta".
- Bhuvaneshvari : The Goddess as Mother of the World , or whose body is the cosmos .
- Bhairavi : The Fierce Goddess .
- Chinnamasta : The self-decapitated Goddess.
- Dhumavati: The Widow Goddess, or Goddess of Death.
- Bagalamukhi : The Goddess who paralyzes enemies .
- Matangi: The Prime Minister of Lalita, the "tantric Sarasvati".
- Kamala: The Goddess of the Lotus, the "tantric Lakshmi".

## History of the origins of the Ten Mahavidyas

Sati, the consort of Shiva was the daughter of Daksha Prajapati, and a descendant of Brahma. Sati had married Shiva against the wishes of her father who considered him low-ranking and uncivilized. Daksha then performed a great Yajña with the sole purpose of insulting Shiva, he invited all the gods and goddesses except his son-in-law, Sadashiva.

Sati learned of her father Daksha's Yajna from Narada Muni. She thus asked Shiva's permission to attend the Yajna, saying that a daughter did not need an invitation from her father. Shiva said that Daksha was trying to insult him, and therefore even if Sati were present at the Yajna, the fruit of the sacrifice would not be auspicious. Therefore he ordered Sati not to attend the Yajna.

Sati became furious with annoyance at this refusal and showed Shiva her form of Adi Parashakti, the Divine Mother. The oceans raged, the mountains trembled and the atmosphere was filled with the wonder of its form of her.

Shiva began to tremble and tried to flee. But in every direction he tried to flee, the Divine Mother stopped him. The Divine Mother had multiplied into ten different forms, guarding each of the ten directions blocking any escape route for Shiva.

After seeing such powerful Shaktis around him, Shiva asked, “Who are you? Where is my Sati?” Her reply was, “I am your Sati, the furious forms all around you are my ten different incarnations, don't be afraid of them. At this point, Shiva had no other way but to allow Sati to go and see the Yajna.

These ten forms of Adi Shakti are popularly known as Dasa Mahavidya.
