* * *

In Satya Yuga, Daksha performed a Yajña with a desire to take revenge on Shiva. Daksha was angry that his daughter Sati had married Shiva against his wishes. Daksha invited all the deities to the Yajña except Shiva and Sati. Not being invited did not discourage Sati from attending the yagna. But Sati, being an uninvited guest, was given no respect. Also, Daksha insulted Shiva. Sati, unable to bear her father's insults towards her husband, committed suicide by jumping into the stake. When Shiva was informed of her death he became furious. He went to the place where Daksha was performing his Yajna and destroyed the area. Daksha was killed by the Ganas of Shiva.

Shiva carried Sati's body all over the world in a state of extreme pain. At the request of all other gods, Vishnu severed Sati's body into 52 pieces with his Sudarshan Chakra, so that Shiva could return to his sanity and resume his duties.

Various parts of Sati's body fell in different places which came to be known as Shakti Peeth. In all Shakti Peeths, Goddess Shakti is accompanied by a Bhairava (a manifestation of Shiva).
