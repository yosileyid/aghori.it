<img class="border border-warning w-100" src="{{ '/assets/imgs/devas/guhyakali.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />

Kālī is worshiped in many forms, in tantra we can find 10 or 12 Mahavidyas. Widespread is the worship of Mahak ālī , Dakshina K ālī ka, Smashank ālī , and others including Guhyakālī, the secret or hidden form of the Goddess Kālī. It is described in detail in the Mah ā k ā lasamhita (composed in the 10th century) in a section dedicated to it. According to this text Mah ā k ā li is the Primary Goddess of the entire tantric system based on the Vamachara practices. In the Mah ā k ālasamhita the various forms of worship, mantras and yantras related to Guhyakālī are revealed.

Goddess worship is not for everyone and is dedicated only to advanced practitioners, to those Sadhakas who dedicate a lifetime to the mutual exchange of conditions with the Goddess and who know how to protect themselves from the dangers encountered during these powerful rituals.

Guhyakālī is the form of the Goddess beyond human perception and is secretive.
