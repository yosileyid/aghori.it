Radhika Dasi Aghori was born in Germany and met Baba Kishan Das Aghori Ji (also known as Krishna Das) in 1995 and soon became his disciple and stayed with him at Omkareshwar Aghori Peeth near Gauri-Somnath Mandir for several years. After the Baba's Mahasamadhi she took charge of the Ashram. The Omkareshwar Saint Mandal made Mahant Radhika Dasi Aghori in 2009 .

Of the six Chelas that Babaji had one became Nath (Balak Das). Instead Vikram Das, Raj Nath and Lakshman Das, all Indians, have already reached Samadhi, the last two died a few months after the Baba while Vikram Das died in 2014. The other remaining disciple is Govinda Das, author of this site, who now lives in Italy.

In Germany Radhika Dasi worked in a psychiatric hospital as a social worker and it is a curious coincidence that in Europe she and Govinda Das did the same job.

To this day Radhika Dasi takes care of the Ashram in Omkareshwar (MP) while Govinda Das is responsible for making the Aghori known through the web, a reality that is little known and often misunderstood by both Hindus and Westerners.

## In Her Own Words:

<pre class="text-warning">
It was mid 90's when I was at Guruji's Ashram. I suddenly 
got very ill. It was the rainy season. I had a high fever, 
diarrhoea, could neither eat nor get up and was in 
terrible shape.

Babaji was very worried and spent day and night by my 
side, feeding me water with a spoon, cleaning me and 
all the sheets...

No doctor was ready to walk the hundreds of steps up 
to Gauri Somnath Mandir and our Ashram.

So, one day Guruji fed me some Bhasma (ash) from the 
Dhuni (sacred fire).

After swallowing it, I somehow fell asleep.

After some time, I saw a very bright bright white light 
in the distance. When I focused on it, it got bigger and 
really, really bright.

Suddenly it looked like a tunnel and at very high speed 
it felt like I was flying through that tunnel.

Suddenly I was on MAHAKAALI's knee. She was sitting 
cross-legged and I was lying on my knees like a curled 
up kitten. She very softly she was touching me and she 
was telling me that nothing to worry about, everything 
is fine…

IN THAT MOMENT I FELT INFINITE HAPPINESS AND BLISS...

At that moment I had an idea of ​​what SAT CHIT ANAND is…

Not comparable to any kind of normal human feeling.

After a while I opened my eyes. Guruji was 
giving me the Trishul of Mahakali Murthi.

THROUGH THE GRACE OF MY GURUJI I GOT THIS 
DARSHAN OF MY BELOVED MAHAKAALI.

After that experience with Mahakali, 
I'm not afraid of death. 

Here is another story about Guruji:

Around 2010 a very old pandit ji used to do his daily 
Aum Parikarma in Omkareshwar. As he passed by our Ashram, 
he placed an oil lamp in the roadside temple every day.

One day Panditji came in and told a story:

He would come every day, put the Deepak and leave with 
Guruji, talking to him on his way home.

One day, Panditji was thinking, 
  "How is this possible? Babaji is dead."

THAT'S ALL.
After that he no longer had Guruji's company.

One day Sri Niwas Ji told me, if I want Guruji always with me, 
I should hold both ankles of his feet and worship them...

- Once in a dream I only saw Guruji's feet walking.
- Next time I saw Guruji's legs in Padma Asana.
- The third time I was sitting with Babloo and Dinesh at a 
table drinking tea when Guruji came and sat with us at the table.

I asked both boys if Guruji was really there. They said yes.

So as I was pinching Guruji in his arm and convinced myself, 
yes it is there.

When I wanted to touch his legs he started to run away. 
I followed quickly. Suddenly he jumped into a small white 
car and drove away. A friend of mine jumped in front of 
the car to stop him, but nothing to do.

When he tried to escape, he recognized that the road ended at a wall.
He quickly got out of the car and started hiding.
On both sides of the road where cars park.
He went to the right, between the cars...
I thought: “surely I'll find it on the left side”...
AND I DID. I TOOK IT AND LOVED HER FEET.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GAME BY MAYA (ILLUSION).
