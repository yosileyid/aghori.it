Kishan Das Aghori (also known as Krishna Das Aghori) was one of the very few Aghoris who lived in the last century, still only a few hundred are counted in all of India. The official date of his Samadhi is 27 March 2005. He Never left his Dhuni (sacred fire) except on some rare occasion. Meeting him at the Ashram made me relive the ancient experiences of this family of Sadhus. His teachings were precious jewels of wisdom, clever shortcuts to self-realization. With those who stopped at his Dhuni in search of spiritual refreshment he was a loving father, full of attention but without attachment. He didn't really like those who came to him looking for amulets or magic.

As he said, he had no disciples but sons, however there are only 6 of his chelas, 2 Westerners and 4 Indians: Govinda Das, author of this site and first disciple in chronological order, in 1989; Balak Das, who later became a Nath; Vikram Das, who died in 2014; Radhika Dasi, born in Germany, who after the Baba's Mahasamadhi took charge of the ashram; Raj Nath and Lakshman Das died soon after the baba in 2005.

Kishan Das lived for many years in Omkareshwar one of the most evocative of the sacred cities in India. The small town on the banks of the Narmada River is famous for its Om-shaped island and for hosting one of the 12 Joth Lingams (representations of Shiva). Near the ancient temple of Gori Somnath in the center of the island you will find the Samadhi of him.

Kishan Das was a chela (disciple) of [Baba Manohar Das]({{ '/ag/manohar' | absolute_url }}) of Weir - Bharatpur, later he decided to become an Aghori with his guru's blessing. He went to Kashi, Kina Ram Ashram and was initiated into the agora sadhana, but the sadhus of the ashram decided not to change the name from Das to Ram and add Aghori to Kishan Das, they said it was not possible because he was already registered as a sadhu. So from there he became Kishan Das Aghori, later he went to Omkareshwar.
