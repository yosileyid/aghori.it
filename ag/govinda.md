Govinda Das Aghori (Jimmy Penzo - Chioggia 27/1/63), author of this site, has undertaken spiritual research since his adolescence. In Italy he visits and deepens various schools and in 1986 he arrives in India discovering the sadhu avadhut. He lives in various ashrams experiencing various sadhanas (spiritual paths) until he arrives in Omkareshwar in 1989 and meets Baba Kishan Das Aghori. Fascinated by the Aghora philosophy, he became a disciple of the Baba, remaining at his ashram for several years.

Back in Italy he worked as an Ayurvedic masseur and yoga teacher.

He currently lives in Perugia, got married and works in a therapeutic rehabilitation community in the mental health sector.

The site aims to spread and make known the Aghori culture too often misunderstood and stigmatized as an obscure "cult".
