In tantra the mother / female form of godhood is a partner who completes godhood, she is the avatar of kundalini, there are many different names for her across all of India, but the name is only an "explanation" of the force or energy she holds power over in the divine sense. This page lists only a few of those forms. To view more follow the links at the bottom of the page.

### Shakti Devi 

<img class="w-100 border border-warning" src="{{ '/assets/imgs/devas/shakti.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />

Shakti means strength, power, female energy; it is the female demonstration of the divine one. The veneration of the various forms of Shakti is largely diffused in India.

Toward halves the first millennium it affirms in the Asian subcontinent a new spiritual and religious tide: the shaktism. A myriad of forms of the great mother went to place side by side to the preexisting masculine hinduist divinities forming some divine couples. This tide notably also influenced the Buddhism so that to the various figures of the Buddhas were placed side by side by a female figure. 

Next to the masculine divinity,that represents the unchangeable one, there is the female divinity ,representing the strength, the power and therefore the divine energy. This is a real religious revolution that also corresponds to a new spiritual view. In the VII century AD the shaktism produced its sacred texts: the Tantras. The deepest roots of shaktism and tantrism can be individualized in the cult of the great mother of the prevedic people. These cults have analogies in the whole rest of the world and bring us to the origins of the spirituality. 

Kali or Durga, black Mothers in the most ancient cultures, black goddesses in ancient Greece or black Christians Madonnas comes from one prototype. An archaic divinity that has withstood the sexist traditions as that Vedic, and that resurfaces with new vitality with the Durga and Kali cults in all their forms.

## Durga

<img class="border border-warning w-100" src="{{ '/assets/imgs/devas/durga.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />

Durga, the great mother, was born from the union of all the energies of the masculine divinities worn out by the endless struggle with the Asuras (demons). In her many arms handed the emblems of all the divinities. Its strength is dreadful. The goddess defeats Mahishasura, such a powerful demon to compromised the equilibrium of the whole universe. She kills him several times but every time the demon rise even more strong assuming more and more terrible forms. Finally, thanks to the energy she got drinking a cup of sacred wine, Durga cuts off the head of Mahishasura killing the demon definately. Finally the Devas (Gods) can relax and they solemnly honored Durga that since then is also called Mahishasuramardini (She that killed Mahisha the great demon).

## Kali-Ma

The black goddess appears for the first time in the Devi Mahatmya or Durga Saptasati from the Marcandeya Purana. The devotion to Kali,, the goddess that more expresses the archetype of the great mother, has its fulcrum in the tantrism. Her form so terrible symbolizes the power, the strength, the good that defeats the evil, and is the demonstration of the divine power. Black because it is the color where everything disappears, also called Digambari (dressed of sky), Naked and with great breasts as the primordial goddesses.

### Mahanirvana Tantra

* * *

Shiva in the Mahanirvana Tantra describes Kali thus:

<pre class="text-warning">
As white, yellow, and other colours all disappear in black, 
in the same way all beings enter Kali.

Therefore it is that by those who have attained the knowledge 
of the means of final liberation, the attributeless, formless, 
and beneficent Kalashakti is endowed with the colour of blackness.

As the eternal and inexhaustible One image of Kala and soul of 
beneficence is nectar itself, therefore the sign of the Moon is 
placed on her forehead. As She surveys the entire universe, which 
is the product of time, with Her three eyes – the Moon, the Sun, 
and Fire – therefore she is endowed with three eyes.

As She devours all existence, as She chews all things existing 
with her fierce teeth, therefore a mass of blood is imagined to 
be the apparel of the Queen of the Devas (at the final dissolution).

As time after time She protects all beings from danger, and as She 
directs them in the paths of duty, her hands are lifted up to dispel 
fear and grant blessings.

As She encompasses the universe, which is the product of Rajoguna, 
she is spoken of, as the Devi who is seated on the red lotus, gazing 
at Kala drunk with intoxicating wine and playing with the universe. 
The Devi also, whose substance is intelligence, witnesseth all things.
