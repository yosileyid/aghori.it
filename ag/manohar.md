Baba Manohar Das guru of Kishan Das Aghori lived in Weir - Bharatpur district - Rajasthan where you will find his samadhi and temple 'Baba Manohar Das Ji Mandir'. A soul of rare qualities and refined knowledge, well known in Rajasthan where there are many devotees of him.

### Guruji went into Maha Samadhi on 16th December 1958.

Baba, through his penance and renunciation, has given his teachings to this Epicurean world: This human life is not for enjoyment but rather for self-improvement. According to him, giving up food and water and going to the solitudes of the forest will not lead to liberation. By giving the world the teachings of true and true sacrifice, he said, through introspection and taking only the middle path, eternal truth can be attained.

As the fragrance of a flower makes the whole environment fragrant, thus further spreading its fragrance in all directions. Similarly Mahatma Manohardas Ji Maharaj spread the wisdom of him from his birthplace "laghukashi" to more distant places, with the impact of his penance and sacrifice of him.

### Every living object in this world has a time limit.
  
In this entire world every living object deteriorates eventually, in a more or less long time. This is why this world is called transient. <code>"kalo hi durati kramah"</code> according to the previous saying, no one can escape being devoured by time. Whether he is the creator of the world Brahma or a mere ant, both are related to the passage of time.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Swami Vivekananda says, â€œA person who is unknown to the truth and ignorantly indulges in debauchery is not on the right path, but on the other hand a person who walks in the forest lamenting the world, stabs his body and lets it perish. his heart like a desert, crushing all his emotions and becoming stiff, aberrant and severe, he too has forgotten the path, both are at extremes and both are in delusion, both are astray from the path. scope.

The path that Baba has shown to the world says, there is no need to bring about changes in one's country, caste, community or appearance and beyond that one must take the path as told in the scriptures and honestly fulfill one's duties along with benevolence for humanity. Baba showed people the via media with integrity so that they would embrace the eternal truth instead of sacrificing their precious human life in the consuming fire of debauchery. One can make one's life fruitful by understanding the mortality of life and making better use of it for the benefit of humanity.
