* * *

Sarasvati Devi (Eleonora Mariotti - Perugia 19/06/55) attended the Art Institute and the Academy of Fine Arts. After 15 years of clerical work, she chose to undertake the artistic activity of breathing fire and performs in squares together with acrobats and stilt walkers. Street artists are in fact some of the subjects that populate her paintings. Images and memories of her many trips to India are also represented in her works. Her works have been exhibited at the Luzzara prize, where she landed in 1994, at the Antoniano of Bologna in '98 and at the AIPAM (international association for the promotion of naive art).
